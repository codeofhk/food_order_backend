# feature / future plans

- adding picture for outlet (atleast name)
- check datamodel for every data being sent or received using class datamodel in model.py
- multiple outlet order
- adding authorization
- if sent amount is not the specified amount , initiate refund
- amount could be changed just before the transaction (potential hack)
